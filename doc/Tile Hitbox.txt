Tile hitboxes are a custom property on the tile called activators or activator hitboxes or
detectors for detector hitboxes.
The property "hitboxes" shall be a string that can be parsed as an JSON array of the following object:
{
  type: int?, // what to do when a collision is detected
  start_x: int?, // where the hitbox's x coordinate begins
  width: int?, // hitbox's width
  start_y: int?, // where the hitbox's y coordinate begins
  height: int?, // hitbox's height
}

If any optional field is missing it is filled it according to this object:
{
  type: 0x1,
  start_x: 0,
  width: 32
  start_y: 0,
  height: 32,
}

Type ids are bitflags with these fields for activators

constexpr ActivatorCollideType ActivatorCollideType::WALL(0x1); // Acts like a wall
constexpr ActivatorCollideType ActivatorCollideType::HIT(0x2); // Hurts sprites

Type ids are bitflags with these fields for detectors

none are valid for tiles as of now
